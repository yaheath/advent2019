# Fun with pipes and FIFOs!
# For this puzzle, I modified intcode.awk to let you pass in an
# initial input on the command line. When the program executes the
# `input` instructions for the first time, it will use the value of
# FIRSTINPUT (if provided) instead of reading it from stdin.
# Subsequent `input` instructions read from stdin as normal. This
# way, we can simply chain together the "amplifiers" which now will
# repeatedly read inputs and write outputs.
#
# We also need to feed back the output of the last stage into the
# first stage. To accomplish that, the run() function will read the
# values from the end of the pipeline and then write them into the
# start of the pipeline. FIFOs (also called named pipes) are employed
# to make this possible.
