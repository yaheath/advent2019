# This is a bit kludgy but seems to work OK.
# Because there are some leftovers of some chemicals after
# running all the reations, it's more efficient (in terms
# of ORE consumed per FUEL produced) to produce larger
# quantities of FUEL at once (economy of scale FTW). As
# the quantity increases, the efficiency increases until
# it converges to be close to a certain value. But it
# will still vary from one quantity to the next.
#
# Perhaps there's a way to do the math to determine
# exactly how much can be produced from a given quantity
# of ORE. Since IANAM*, my approach is to run the reaction
# on different quantites until I find the one closest to the
# target.
#    *I am not a mathematician
#
# First, get into the ballpark by running the reaction
# to get a sufficiently large (but otherwise arbitrary)
# quantity, and get an estimate of how many FUEL to make.
# Run that estimate, and adjust it up or down and repeat
# until we converge on the target.
