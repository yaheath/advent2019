# Here's an instance where it would have been nice to be able
# to use recursion. Technically, you can do recursion in awk,
# but it's REALLY tricky. Remember, the only way to make a
# variable be local to a function is to make it an argument of
# that function. So any variable you might need in your recursive
# function (e.g., a loop counter) has to be included as one
# of the arguments.
#
# And since arrays are passed by reference in awk, you can't
# make an array local to a function at all (I think).
#
# Anyway, turns out that a queue-based approach works well
# for this solution. The queue contains the chemicals that
# need to be made along with the quantity needed; and it
# starts out with just the target "FUEL" chemical. Take
# one from the head of the queue, figure out the quantities,
# and push each prerequisite onto the end of the queue,
# unless the prerequisite is "ORE" which doesn't need to
# be made. Repeat until the queue is empty.
